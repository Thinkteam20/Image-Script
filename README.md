Batch image compression

Dont foget to init

`npm i`

To run tiny image, add images to the "tozip" and run 

`npm run minify`

- It's dumb and will run on all files in the "tozip" folder without checking to see if you have done so already. 
- You have been warned !!!
- We have 500 free compressions per month.
